# Lesson Plan

## Workshop Overview _(all together)_

The workshop instructor will introduce the main concepts of this workshop:

- Introduce the workshop's [learning objectives](./README.md#learning-objectives).
- Demonstrate _predictive stepping_ in a debugger.

## Practice Predictive Stepping _(small groups)_

Have one person in your group share their screen, then practice asking and
answering these questions as you study the programs in
[/0_stepping_through](./0_stepping_through):

Before each step:

- Which line will run next?
- What will change in memory? (_variables_ and _callstack_!)

After each step:

- Were your predictions correct?
- If now, why? What did you miss when you made your prediction?
